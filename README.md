# 2D-fortran-code-of-wave-generation-by-SPH-method
This is a simple Fortran code of 2d wave generation by piston type wavemaker which is based on Smoothed Particles Hydrodynamics(SPH).Source files of this fortran code is nearly same as my 1st repository "2D-Fortran-code-of-dam-break-using-SPH".Couple of modifications is done such as creating moving piston type wavemaker,adding damping zone, etc.To run the simulation one has to run the executable file "wave_generation_2d.exe". if you find any bug or problem in running the simulation u can notify me or u are free to change the source code situated in "Source files" folder. To modify the source code one has to recompile the source files in "Source" folder to create new executable file(.exe).The source files were compiled with ifort compiler.
